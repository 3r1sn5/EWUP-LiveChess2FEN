LiveChess2FEN is a fully functional framework that automatically digitizes
the configuration of a chessboard. It is optimized for execution on a
Nvidia Jetson Nano.

## Setup

1. Install Python 3.5 or later and the following dependencies:
    - NumPy
    - OpenCV4
    - Matplotlib
    - scikit-learn
    - pillow
    - pyclipper
    - tqdm

2. Depending on the inference engine install the following dependencies:
    - (Optional) Keras with tensorflow backend. Slower than ONNX.
    - ONNX Runtime.
    - (Optional) TensorRT. Fastest available, although more tricky to set up.
    
3. Create a `selected_models` and a `predictions` folder in the project root.
4. Download the prediction models from the 
 [releases](https://github.com/davidmallasen/LiveChess2FEN/releases)
 and save them to the `selected_models` folder.
5. Download the contents of `TestImages.zip->FullDetection` from the
[releases](https://github.com/davidmallasen/LiveChess2FEN/releases) into
 the `predictions` folder. You should have 5 test images and a
 boards.fen file.
6. Edit `test_lc2fen.py` and set the `ACTIVATE_*`, `MODEL_PATH_*`,
 `IMG_SIZE_*` and `PRE_INPUT_*` constants.
7. Run the `test_lc2fen.py` script.
